  - Impressions and CTR for Earn tile and Green Investments card.
  - Conversion to start streak, contribution rates, and retention lift.

7. Why This Will Succeed
- Real, valuable rewards for sustainable behavior.
- Privacy-first, anti-cheat technology builds trust.
- Engaging community features and transparent impact reporting.
- Robust admin tools ensure smooth, error-free operation.
- Financial safety rules and dynamic controls keep rewards sustainable long-term.

8. Financial Sustainability & Tokenomics Safety Rules (Non‑Negotiable)
Goal: Reward users generously while ensuring the program never endangers token health, treasury stability, or long-term profitability. Rewards must auto-scale with revenues and reserves so we never "play ourselves to dead."

A. Solvency & Budget Guardrails
- Hard Solvency Rule: Total reward liabilities (points, unvested grants, outstanding redemptions) must be ≤ Liquid Reward Reserve at all times.
- Reward Reserve: Segregated treasury for rewards; cannot be tapped by operations except via governance. Target minimum runway: 12 months of projected reward costs.
- Emission Budget Cap: Max gross rewards issued per epoch (day/week) = min(X% of 30d net revenue, Y% of Reward Reserve after floor). Defaults: X=15%, Y=1.5%. Governance adjustable within safe bounds.

B. Dynamic Health-Scaled Rewards
- Program Health Score (0–100) computed daily from:
  - Reserve Ratio = Liquid Reward Reserve / Reward Liabilities
  - Runway Months = Reserve / 30d average reward outflow
  - 30d Net Revenue Growth
  - Token 30d volatility and drawdown
  - Redemption Queue Depth and Fulfillment SLA
- Reward Multiplier Table:
  - Health ≥ 80: 1.0x base rewards
  - 60–79: 0.8x
  - 40–59: 0.6x
  - 20–39: 0.4x
  - <20: 0.2x and new high-value awards paused
- Base rewards are defined per streak tier; multipliers adjust issuance automatically.

C. Circuit Breakers & Auto‑Throttling
- Immediate throttle (50% cut) if any:
  - Reserve Ratio < 1.1
  - Runway < 9 months
  - 30d Net Revenue < 0 for 14 consecutive days
  - Token drawdown > 35% in 14 days
- Full pause on high-value redemptions if:
  - Reserve Ratio < 1.0, or
  - Redemption backlog > 14 days, or
  - Security/market incident flagged by governance
- Auto-recovery: Resume normal levels only after 14 consecutive "healthy" days.

D. Funding Sources & Separation
- Allowed inflows: share of net operating revenue, sponsorships/partnerships, carbon credits, marketplace fees, specifically earmarked grants.
- Disallowed inflows: borrowing against core treasury beyond governance-approved limits; unsustainable token emission beyond caps.
- Diversification: Maintain a floor (e.g., 50–70%) of Reward Reserve in low-volatility assets (stablecoins/fiat) with short-duration yield; cap exposure to volatile assets.

E. Liability Management & Redemption Controls
- Liability Ledger: Track all outstanding points, token-denominated promises, unvested rewards; mark-to-market daily.
- Dynamic Point-to-Token Rate: Points redeem to token or goods at a floating rate derived from Health Score and price/volatility; never fixed in a way that forces insolvency.
- Cooldowns & Caps: Per-user daily redemption caps, global daily cap tied to Emission Budget, FIFO queue with transparent ETA.
- Vesting for Big Rewards: 3–12 month vesting/lockups for token-denominated or high-value items to smooth outflows.
- Hedging: If liabilities are in volatile tokens, hold matching assets or hedges to neutralize exposure.

F. Cost & Unit Economics Checks
- Max Reward Cost per Verified Car‑Free Day must be ≤ Target CPA and ≤ Z% of expected LTV uplift from user retention/engagement attributable to the program.
- Milestone rewards (e.g., Gaia Solar Bike) require a pre-allocated budget and sponsorship offsets; fulfillment cannot create deficits.

G. Emission & Inventory Caps
- Hard caps per season/quarter for:
  - Token emissions to rewards
  - Number of high-value items fulfilled
- Unsold inventory or underused budget rolls forward only if Health ≥ 70; otherwise it reduces future budgets to rebuild reserves.

H. Monitoring, Stress Tests, and Audits
- Daily: reserve ratio, runway, emission vs cap, redemption queue, revenue inflow vs outflow.
- Weekly: scenario stress tests (25–50% revenue shock, 2–3x redemption surge).
- Monthly: externalized financial report; internal audit of controls and liabilities.
- Quarterly: third-party review of tokenomics and treasury policies.

I. Governance & Change Management
- Parameter changes (X, Y, thresholds, multipliers) require multi-sig and/or DAO vote with a cooling-off period, except emergency breakers.
- Emergency Council can trigger circuit breakers; all actions are logged and disclosed.

J. "No Negative Spiral" Rule
- The system must never sell large amounts of token into thin markets to fund rewards. Preference order: fiat/stable reserves, sponsorship credits, non-price-impacting fulfillment (in-kind), then limited OTC with VWAP constraints.

K. Transparency
- Public dashboard of impact and financial health (redemption SLAs, caps used, reserves, emissions).
- Clear comms to users when multipliers or redemptions adjust due to health rules, with ETAs and rationale.
