# Regeneration Mining Pools

## Overview
Revolutionary mining concept that transforms traditional cryptocurrency mining into active environmental regeneration through proof-of-impact consensus mechanisms. This module creates mining pools where computational power and rewards are directly tied to verified environmental restoration projects.

## What is PoEI?
**Proof-of-Environmental-Impact (PoEI)** is a novel consensus mechanism that links mining rewards to verified environmental restoration projects. It ensures that computational power contributes directly to measurable ecological benefits, verified through satellite data, IoT sensors, and third-party audits.

## Features

### Core Mining Concept
- **Proof-of-Environmental-Impact (PoEI)**: See [What is PoEI?](#what-is-poei) for details on this consensus mechanism linking mining rewards to environmental restoration
- **Verified Impact Metrics**: Satellite verification, IoT sensors, and third-party audits ensure legitimate impact
- **Dynamic Reward Scaling**: Mining rewards adjust based on environmental urgency and measured impact

### Pool Categories
- **Forest Restoration Pools**: Mining rewards tied to verified reforestation projects
- **Ocean Cleanup Pools**: Rewards based on documented ocean plastic removal
- **Carbon Sequestration Pools**: Mining linked to verified carbon capture initiatives
- **Renewable Energy Pools**: Rewards for supporting clean energy infrastructure
- **Biodiversity Preservation Pools**: Mining tied to habitat protection and species conservation

### Technical Implementation
- Multi-signature verification systems
- Time-locked reward release mechanisms
- Continuous monitoring and quality assurance
- Dispute resolution protocols
- Community validation systems

## Economics & Incentives
- **Base Mining Rewards**: 40% of total rewards
- **Impact Multipliers**: 30% for environmental impact
- **Community Bonuses**: 20% for community participation
- **Platform Development**: 10% for infrastructure

## Environmental Impact
- Direct funding for conservation projects
- Incentivized environmental restoration
- Measurable carbon sequestration
- Biodiversity protection and habitat restoration
