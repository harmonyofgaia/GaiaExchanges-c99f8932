# GAiA Animal Welfare NFT Platform - Expanded Plan Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the expanded GAiA Animal Welfare NFT Platform, featuring dual funding mechanisms, AI-powered animal search, community Vault system, and comprehensive transparency tracking.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. AI-Powered Caged Animal Search System
**Component:** `src/components/animal-welfare/AIAnimalSearch.tsx`
