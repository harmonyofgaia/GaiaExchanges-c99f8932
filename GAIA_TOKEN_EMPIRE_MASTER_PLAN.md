## 🏛️ Smart Community Vault Architecture

### 1. **Community Vault Core System**

#### 1.1 Vault Health Metrics Engine
```typescript
interface VaultHealthMetrics {
  totalBalance: number;
  lockedCoreReserves: number;
  availableBalance: number;
  dailyInflow: number;
  dailyOutflow: number;
  weeklyTrend: number;
  monthlyGrowthRate: number;
  riskLevel: 'GREEN' | 'YELLOW' | 'RED';
  healthScore: number; // 0-100
  projectedDays: number; // Days until critical if current trend continues
}
```

#### 1.2 Dynamic Health Status System
- **GREEN Status (80-100 Health Score)**:
  - Vault balance > 90% of target reserves
  - Positive growth trend for 30+ days
  - Daily inflow exceeds outflow by 20%+
  - Maximum reward multipliers active (1.5x-2.0x)
  - All features fully accessible
  - Bonus reward pools activated

- **YELLOW Status (50-79 Health Score)**:
  - Vault balance 50-90% of target reserves
  - Mixed or neutral growth trends
  - Daily inflow/outflow balanced ±20%
  - Standard reward multipliers (1.0x-1.4x)
  - All features accessible with monitoring
  - Conservative payout rates

- **RED Status (0-49 Health Score)**:
  - Vault balance < 50% of target reserves
  - Negative growth trend detected
  - Daily outflow exceeds inflow
  - Reduced reward multipliers (0.5x-0.9x)
  - Emergency protocols activated
  - Minimum guaranteed payouts only

### 2. **Locked Core Reserve System**

#### 2.1 Multi-Tier Reserve Structure
```typescript
interface CoreReserves {
  emergencyReserve: number;     // 25% of total - Never touchable
  stabilityReserve: number;     // 20% of total - RED status only
  growthReserve: number;        // 15% of total - YELLOW+ status
  operationalReserve: number;   // 20% of total - Daily operations
  rewardPool: number;           // 20% of total - Available rewards
}
```

#### 2.2 Reserve Protection Protocols

## ⚡ Dynamic Adjustment Logic & Auto-Fluctuation System

### 3. **Smart Reward Fluctuation Algorithm**

#### 3.1 Vault-Based Reward Multipliers
```typescript
const REWARD_MULTIPLIER_CONFIG = [
  { minScore: 90, multiplier: 2.0 },  // Maximum rewards
  { minScore: 80, multiplier: 1.75 }, // High rewards
  { minScore: 70, multiplier: 1.5 },  // Above standard
  { minScore: 60, multiplier: 1.25 }, // Standard+
  { minScore: 50, multiplier: 1.0 },  // Standard
  { minScore: 40, multiplier: 0.85 }, // Reduced
  { minScore: 30, multiplier: 0.7 },  // Low
  { minScore: 20, multiplier: 0.55 }, // Critical
];

class DynamicRewardSystem {
  calculateRewardMultiplier(vaultHealth: VaultHealthMetrics): number {
    const baseMultiplier = 1.0;
    
    // Input validation
    if (!vaultHealth || typeof vaultHealth.healthScore !== 'number' || vaultHealth.healthScore < 0 || vaultHealth.healthScore > 100) {
      console.error("Invalid vaultHealth input:", vaultHealth);
      return baseMultiplier * 0.4; // Default to minimum guaranteed multiplier
    }
    
    const healthScore = vaultHealth.healthScore;
    
    for (const config of REWARD_MULTIPLIER_CONFIG) {
      if (healthScore >= config.minScore) {
        return baseMultiplier * config.multiplier;
      }
    }
    return Math.max(baseMultiplier * 0.4, 0.1); // Minimum guaranteed
  }
}
```

### 4. **Anti-Drain Logic & Smart Payout Caps**

#### 4.1 Intelligent Payout Limitation System
```typescript
interface PayoutCaps {
  maxDailyUserPayout: number;      // Per user daily limit
  maxHourlySystemPayout: number;   // Total system hourly limit
  maxSingleTransactionPayout: number; // Individual transaction limit
  emergencyBrakeThreshold: number; // Auto-pause threshold
}

class AntiDrainProtection {
  validatePayout(amount: number, userId: string, vaultHealth: VaultHealthMetrics): boolean {
    const userDailyTotal = this.getUserDailyTotal(userId);
    const systemHourlyTotal = this.getSystemHourlyTotal();
    
    // Dynamic caps based on vault health
    const caps = this.calculateDynamicCaps(vaultHealth);
    
    if (userDailyTotal + amount > caps.maxDailyUserPayout) return false;
    if (systemHourlyTotal + amount > caps.maxHourlySystemPayout) return false;
    if (amount > caps.maxSingleTransactionPayout) return false;
    if (vaultHealth.availableBalance - amount < caps.emergencyBrakeThreshold) return false;
    
    return true;
  }
}
```
